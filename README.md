# Dota Draft Simulator

This is currently a WiP.

# Background
DOTA 2 is an online multiplayer game, with each game consisting of five players on two teams. There are currently 119 heroes (characters) to choose from, each with unique abilities and stats. 

One important aspect of a DOTA game is the 'drafting process', where each team takes it in turn to ban and pick heroes. A hero can only be picked once per game, and banning it prohibits either team from selecting it. As such, the draft is a highly contested portion of a game, and some games can largely be decided in this portion as many heroes' strengthes are varied, with some abilities strongly countering other heroes. 

Each team has 35 seconds to select a hero (whether banning or picking), refreshed every time the draft returns to them. Each team also has a bank of 130 seconds of reserve time, which is only used when this initial 30 seconds is used. This reserve time does not refresh at any point during the draft.
